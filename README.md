# Segues-AfterHours
CC's After Hours project with more practice on segues

Begin by forking and cloning this repository. 

On the main.storyboard file, add labels and text fields to the 'Add Treat View Controller'.
Put these elements in a stack view and add contraints.
Create outlets and hook them up to the correct file.

Add various segues throughout the scenes. 
Update all files with the 'prepare for segue' function.
